    "Covariance: Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. It quantifies the directional relationship between two variables. A positive covariance indicates that when one variable is above its mean, the other tends to be above its mean as well, and vice versa for below-mean values. A negative covariance suggests that one variable tends to be above its mean when the other is below its mean.\n",
    "Correlation: Correlation, on the other hand, is a standardized measure that assesses both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It measures how well the relationship between two variables can be described by a straight line. Correlation values range between -1 (perfect negative linear relationship) and 1 (perfect positive linear relationship), with 0 indicating no linear relationship.\n",
    "Units:\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance: Covariance is not standardized, and its units are the product of the units of the two variables being measured. This makes it difficult to interpret and compare across different datasets or variables with different units.\n",
    "Correlation: Correlation is unitless, which makes it easy to compare relationships between variables measured in different units.\n",
    "Range:\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance: Covariance can take any value, including positive and negative values. The magnitude of covariance does not have a specific range.\n",
    "Correlation: Correlation values always fall between -1 and 1, providing a clear and interpretable measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance: Covariance alone does not provide a clear interpretation of the strength or direction of the relationship between two variables. It only indicates whether the variables tend to move together or in opposite directions.\n",
    "Correlation: Correlation provides a standardized measure that is easier to interpret. A positive correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well, and vice versa. A negative correlation suggests that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
